I investigated whether there is a difference in the level of semantic similarity
of the sentence containing an anaphor and the sentence containing its
antecedent, and the anaphor sentence and other nearby sentences. The purpose was
to see if semantic similarity can be used to determine the sentence containing
an anaphor’s antecedent from a group of candidate sentences. Sentence similarity
was calculated between pairs of sentences by combining scores for various
WordNet similarity measures between nouns and between verbs in each sentence, as
well as Google’s word2vec using the large Google News model.
