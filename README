Calculates sentence similarity scores.

The basic function is compare_sentences in sentence_similarity.py. This
takes two unicode sentences and returns a list of various similarity scores.
The order of the scores is: noun_path, noun_lch, noun_wup, noun_res,
noun_jcn, noun_lin, noun_lesk, noun_vector, verb_path, verb_lch, verb_wup,
verb_res, verb_jcn, verb_lin, verb_lesk, verb_vector, word2vec, [LSA]

LSA is not currently included because it is extremely slow. It can be
re-added by uncommenting the LSA lines in compare_sentences as well as lines
21 and 22 in similarity_measures.py.
