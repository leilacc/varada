Calculates sentence similarity scores.

***************COMPARING SENTENCES******************

The basic function is compare_sentences in sentence_similarity.py. This
takes two unicode sentences and returns a list of various similarity scores.
The order of the scores is: noun_path, noun_lch, noun_wup, noun_res,
noun_jcn, noun_lin, noun_lesk, noun_vector, verb_path, verb_lch, verb_wup,
verb_res, verb_jcn, verb_lin, verb_lesk, verb_vector, word2vec, [LSA]

LSA is not currently included because it is extremely slow. It can be
re-added by uncommenting the LSA lines in compare_sentences as well as lines
21 and 22 in similarity_measures.py.

compare_sentences relies (directly or indirectly) on nltk,
stanford-postagger, lesk.conf, lsa_init.py, sentence_to_synset.py,
server.pm, similarity_measures.py, stanford_tagger.pyc, tag.py, and
word2vec.py.

Before compare_sentences is run, server.pm must be started using the
command `perl server.pm`. This allows Lesk and vector WordNet similarity
scores to be calculated efficiently using perl's WordNet::Similarity package.


***************ANAPHORS AND ANTECEDENTS******************

For the purpose of calculating similarity scores between anaphors and
potential antecedents, ana_ante_sim.py is run. It calls compare_sentences
using anaphor and antecedent data in .dump files. Similarity results
for each anaphor/candidate antecedents group are saved in .csv files.
Each .csv file is named for the group's key, and placed in a subdirectory
of results/ named for the anaphor's shell noun.

After running ana_ante_sim.py to calculate each similarity score, run
get_averages.py to calculate the average similarity score between a
candidate sentence and the anaphor. ana_ante_sim is quite slow since each
compare_sentences call takes ~1 min. However get_averages takes <1 min total.


***************TROUBLESHOOTING******************

-make sure you are on broca, where most packages are installed
-make sure you have run `perl server.pm`
-make sure WNHOME is set: `export WNHOME=/p/cl/wordnet2.0/`
-make sure you are using perl packages that were installed locally
 `export PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:/u/leila/perl5/lib/perl:/u/leila/perl5/lib/perl5:/u/leila/perl5/share/perl:/u/leila/perl5/lib/perl/share/perl`
